# 🛡️ Aegis Rights — A Phone for the Powerless

---

## 📌 Overview

**Aegis Rights** is a humanitarian rugged smartphone designed to offer **digital protection and connectivity** to those in vulnerable, under-resourced, or high-risk environments — such as **activists, low-income individuals, students, and displaced populations**.

> “Your small shield in the digital war zone.”

## 🌍 Guiding Principles

- **Affordability First**  
  Target price range: **$130–150 USD** to maximize accessibility.

- **Privacy & Digital Security**  
  Features include stealth mode, physical kill switches, and secure comms — with **no spyware or backdoors**.

- **Repairability & Modularity**  
  Durable polycarbonate chassis with accessible design, modular DSSS support, and a **universal charging system**.

- **Rugged but Humane**  
  Built to survive disasters (IP68+, MIL-STD-810H), but **not militarized** in appearance or branding.
