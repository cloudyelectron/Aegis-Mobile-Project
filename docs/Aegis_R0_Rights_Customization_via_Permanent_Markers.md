# Aegis R0 Rights — Customization via Permanent Markers

## 🎨 Concept: Personal Canvas of Rights

Aegis R0 Rights is designed for the people—people who have their own stories, identities, and messages to share.

By offering a way to personalize their phones with **non-toxic permanent markers** that work on polycarbonate surfaces, we empower users to turn their device into a form of expression:

---

### ✏️ Use Cases

- **Identity Marking:**
  - Users can write their name, unit ID, or contact tag directly onto the back of the R0.
  - In low-resource regions, groups can mark multiple units for organization and logistics.

- **Team Symbolism:**
  - NGOs, grassroots orgs, or neighborhood watch groups can create shared visual codes.
  - Easy coordination in field operations.

- **Artistic Expression:**
  - Individuals can draw designs, slogans, or messages that reflect their beliefs or mood.
  - From political statements to personal art, the phone becomes a digital-era diary.

- **Relationship Symbolism:**
  - Couples or friends can decorate their R0s as shared memories or symbols of unity.

### 🧠 Slogan:
> “Draw on your canvas of rights.”

The R0 isn’t just a survival phone—it's a statement. A call to reclaim identity and pride in a world that often forgets the individual.

Let every line drawn on it be a message to the world: **“This is mine. I survive. I speak.”**
