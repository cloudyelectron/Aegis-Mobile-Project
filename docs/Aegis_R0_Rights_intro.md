**1. Background & Purpose**

Billions remain underserved in the digital world—not because smartphones don’t exist, but because those available aren’t designed for survival, stealth, or dignity in dangerous environments. From refugee camps to labor fields to authoritarian states, people need tools, not toys.

**Aegis Rights** is our answer. A modular, rugged, and affordable smartphone designed around **human rights, digital autonomy, and resilience**.

---

**2. Core Values**

- **Defense is a right.** Every human deserves secure communication.
- **Digital dignity.** Even the poorest deserve devices that don’t degrade their identity.
- **Resilience by design.** It must survive drops, dust, water, and power outages.
